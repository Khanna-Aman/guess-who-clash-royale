## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Player 1** secretly picks their own card, then passes the device.
2. **Player 2** secretly picks their own card, then passes the device back.
3. Players alternate turns trying to guess the opponent's card. Each turn, the active player:
   - Uses the **filter dropdowns** to eliminate groups of cards *(costs +1 point each)*.
   - **Clicks cards** to flip/unflip them manually for free.
   - Uses the **Question Log** on the left to track their deduction history.
   - When ready, hits **🎯 Guess (+1)** and types the card name with autocomplete.
4. **Lower score wins** — fewer questions = sharper detective!

### Scoring

| Action | Score |
|---|---|
| Apply a filter | **+1 point** |
| Make a guess | **+1 point** |
| Manual verbal question (`+` button) | **+1 point** |
| Flip / unflip a card | **Free** |
| Undo a filter | **−1 point** |

Score is floored at 0. Results screen shows both scores, winner verdict, a progression graph, and an 8-metric breakdown table.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | HTML5 semantic markup | No build step — works on `file://` protocol |
| **Logic** | Vanilla JavaScript (ES2020) | Zero dependencies, maximum portability |
| **Styles** | CSS with custom properties | Design token system for colours, spacing, and panel widths |
| **Font** | [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) via Google Fonts | 400 → 900 weights |
| **Card Images** | [RoyaleAPI CDN](https://royaleapi.github.io/cr-api-assets/) | Auto-resolved from card name slug |
| **Graph** | Canvas API | HiDPI-aware (`devicePixelRatio`) progression chart |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Auto-deploy + weekly new-card auto-update pipeline |

---

## 🎨 Design System

The UI is themed around the Clash Royale visual language using CSS custom properties:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--cr-blue` | `#2c6fbb` | Primary brand colour, P1 accents |
| `--cr-gold` | `#f5c842` | CTAs, score display, champion border |
| `--cr-purple` | `#7c3aed` | Elixir badges |
| `--cr-bg` | `#0b1628` | Page background |
| `--cr-panel` | `#111d33` | Card and modal surfaces |
| `--rail-width` | `96px` | Secret card rail width |
| `--qlog-width` | `168px` | Question log panel width |
| `--side-clearance` | `calc(...)` | Main board right padding — single source of truth |

**Rarity borders:** Common (grey) · Rare (orange) · Epic (purple) · Legendary (rainbow shimmer animation) · Champion (gold glow pulse)

## 🧱 Data Architecture

Card data is split across three files for clarity of ownership:

| File | Contains | Updated by |
|---|---|---|
| `js/cards.js` | Core facts: `name`, `elixir`, `rarity`, `type`, `target`, `flying`, `hasEvo` | Auto-updated via GitHub Action |
| `js/cards-annotations.js` | Manual layer: `hasHero`, `isGoblin`, `isUndead`, `isMan`, `isHuman` | Human — no API exists for these |
| `js/config-filters.js` | Role sets: `SWARM_CARDS`, `TANK_CARDS`, `SPAWNER_CARDS` | Human — community meta classifications |
| `data/CARDS_DATA.json` | Human-readable mirror of `cards.js` | Reference only |

At runtime, `mergeCoreAndAnnotations()` in `cards-annotations.js` merges all three into the final `CARDS` array used by the game engine.

---

## 🤖 GitHub Actions

### Auto Deploy (`deploy.yml`)
Triggers on every push to `main`. Publishes the root directory to GitHub Pages using the official `actions/deploy-pages` action — no build step required.

### 🃏 Auto Card Update (`check-cards.yml`)
Runs **every Monday at 08:00 UTC** (the day after typical CR patch days). Performs three automated checks:

| Check | What it does | API cost |
|---|---|---|
| ① New cards | Diffs RoyaleAPI open-data vs local `cards.js`, classifies new cards with Gemini | 1 Gemini call per new card |
| ② Hero skin refresh | CDN HEAD probe for every card without a hero skin | Free — no auth |
| ③ Evolution refresh | 1 Gemini call for ALL cards without an evo to check if any now have one | 1 Gemini call total |

If any changes are detected, the script **automatically patches `cards.js`, `CARDS_DATA.json`, `cards-annotations.js`, and `config-filters.js`** and commits them back to `main` — triggering a fresh GitHub Pages deploy.

> **Cost:** Worst case ~4 Gemini Flash calls per week. Free tier limit: 1,500/day. **You will not be charged.**

To use this automation in your own fork:
1. Go to `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`
2. Add a secret named `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) key
3. Enable GitHub Pages via `Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions`
